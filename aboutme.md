Hi everyone :)

I am a former senior programmer at [Bohemia Interactive](https://www.bohemia.net/), where I was responsible for the Arma series. My main focus was on behind-the-scenes and low-level systems, optimization, networking, and security. Before that, I worked at [CGC a.s](https://cgc.sk/) as an integrator of various business-level security devices into a custom integrated security system SBI.

I am also the author of [Gaia-ECS](https://github.com/richardbiely/gaia-ecs), a powerful entity component system written in C++. You can use the framework to elevate any project, big or small, in the gaming or business applications industry. Built on the principles of data-oriented design, Gaia-ECS aims to provide a simple and streamlined framework that allows you to realize your ideas while keeping your projects easy to maintain and performant. You can also use it as a great learning experience.

At some point, I became interested in voxel, which led me to create [Voxe(lmetric)](https://github.com/richardbiely/Voxelmetric) and a few more currently private projects.

Thank you to everybody who has supported my projects and their communities. Your help or advice is greatly appreciated and can influence their future. You rock!
